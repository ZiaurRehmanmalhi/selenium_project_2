Muzamil Nawaz,2 years ago,"Assalamu alaikum Ehmad Bhai,
First things first very informative content you are producing out there, I really appreciate that.
Secondly my concern is, in one of your videos you guys mentioned that reputation of ""University"" is important in our first job as Software Engineer, but let's say if we didn't get the opportunity to join best of institutions, so what's the next important things to do to overcome that lacking?
I hope I made my question clear,
Will be eagerly waiting for your insights.
Thank you ;)
Best regards,
Muzamil",,6
