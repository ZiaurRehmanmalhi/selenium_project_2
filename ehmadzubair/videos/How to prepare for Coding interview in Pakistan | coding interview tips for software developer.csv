Saad Ahmed,1 year ago (edited),"Hi, great video as it provides a good insight into hiring culture of SWE/IT related jobs in Pakistan. I am a 1st semester student at ITU Lahore. What advice would you give to someone who started their CS journey before joining university and are currently ahead of their classmates? I think I have gotten my fundamentals right along with some OOP, I think I only need to polish my understanding and practice concepts like inheritance and polymorphism now. With that, I also love to watch random computerphile or any other good CS related video when I am free so I think I have a decent idea of what's to come. What advice would you have for me if my end goal is to land a good tech job abroad? Should I continue to stay a bit ahead or should I just go with the flow? Note that I don't plan on learning any framework or anything like that until I get my data structures right. Thanks ",https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AGIKgqOnFGgyNSvHsBt_jJq2jc12iTq8fjvsRayM9hJzcg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,3

Aafaq Ahmed,8 months ago,"Hi, First of all I would like to acknowledge that video was really good. I am 6th semester student of BSCS but I also have 2+ year of experience in developing iOS app with swift. Should I consider joining as a Junior iOS dev? Should my expectations be same as fresh graduate? I got diverse experience while doing freelancing. 

Also one more question, should I bring my laptop on interview?",,0

I have a question as you methioned maybe development is not for you if you failing in technical interview.
