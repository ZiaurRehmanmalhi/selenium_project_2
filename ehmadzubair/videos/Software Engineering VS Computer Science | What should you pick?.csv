Murtaza,1 year ago,"Summary:

In terms of courses, SE has a wide and shallow aperture, it focuses on the entire Software Development Lifecycle. While CS has a narrow and deep aperture, as it focuses more on coding and computer architecture.

In terms of job market, it doesn't really matter. Both are seen as synonymous by employers. So get going, and make some money.

At the end of day, Software Engineers have more rishta points due to the 'Engineer' label.",,30

Farhan Bajwa,10 months ago (edited),"Choose CS if you want to learn about computers, in depth theoretical knowledge, hard subjects but definately worth it, subjects that are offered in CS but not in SE are the following 

: Computer architecture and asssembly language 
: design and analysis of algorithms 
: compiler construction 
: Artificial Intelligence 
: Parallel and concurrent programmimg .

All above subjects are not offered in SE degree, tough subjects but worth it. But all the subjects that are important offered in SE are also offered in CS, the SE subjects that are not offered in CS are not that much important.

Chose computer science if you want to innovate in the field of computer science, or want to pursure Master or PHD and want to go in research and teaching field and have a lot of time to work hard because above mentioned subjects are really tough.

Choose SE if you are not sure of you have an apptitude for computer science OR in coding or not. And then if you find interest in this field learn all the above mentioned subjects on your own ( IF YOU WANT ) every things is avaliable on internet you will not regret choosing SE in any way, but if you choose  CS and does not find interest in it things become really tough for you choose wisely .

Also if you want to start job after 4th or 6th semester or spend most of the time during degree on coding OR freelancing I would suggest choose SE , on the other hand if you want to spend your whole degree time on learning choose CS.",,14

Taimoor Sultan,2 months ago,"Software engineering is actually not considered engineering.PEC doesnot recognize it.This degree is recognized by NCEAC which is a council for computing.
Another point to consider is that the global defination of an engineer refers to a person who works on tangible things(things you can physically touch) so technically bsse graduates shouldnot call themselves software engineers as their main concern is only software part of computer.They should call themselves software developers.
 This degree is considered as a degree of computing or IT and that is why the complete name of the degree is BS(Software engineering)(non engineering).",https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AGIKgqMu1YVi1KhnQx5FZd8N7dc4iMl7AjSHAC6YjXqB=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,0
