zoh ahs,1 year ago,Mentorship is the key 1 million $ factor. I left programming back in School in 2020 as I couldn't find anybody  and teachers were busy churning out graduates to flood the market with a tictactoe project made in C and C++ which could be copied off the internet. Really amazes me they  played around with so many futures of their student just to get paycheck at the end of the month!,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AGIKgqNpmWbR2-dFj4N-0BAAe7EKWN8lbNoMGrko8A=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,6

Muhammad Aashir,2 years ago (edited),"I have a question Ehmad, would be glad if you briefly answer it.
I have seen some fresh graduates who combine to make a team of 4-5 people and they start their own company. Behind the scene what is basically happening is they are taking online projects (Freelancing) and portray  themselves as a company rather than a single entity. What do you think about it. Is it effective and good strategy keeping in view growth, sustainability and revenue stream (which is quite high in this case) of each individual?",,1
