Jason Anderson,2 years ago,"Great interview! He gave a lot of insightful information. It was very helpful. 

My name is Jason Anderson, I have been following your channel for some time. I am a recruiter for foreign companies hiring in Pakistan. 

I think Osama's resume format is great. It is well organized and much better than a lot of resumes we get from candidates in Pakistan. However, I do not think his cover letter helped him obtain his current job. The cover letter is filled with spelling mistakes and uses language not commonly used in English. It is also very poorly formatted. 

I would recommend googling cover letter templates to find good examples that have proper grammar and vocabulary.",https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AGIKgqM8cxWr27wUXTgJ9wegzE4UewZ0AwCDQOGb_qc_=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,6
